# Question 7.

Although vaccination continues to be a controversial topic, there is irrefutable evidence and multiple sources of research which proves and advocates for the tremendous benefits associated with immunization. Moreover, these sources of information profoundly emphasize the fact that immunizations have lead to almost full eradication of certain diseases in the United States. For example, polio is a disease that was once greatly feared in the early 1950’s. However, since the passing of the polio vaccine, cases of polio have significantly decreased. It is also often argued that immunization should be an ongoing process until all traces of that specific disease are gone because this is the only certain way to terminate the disease for good.

In 1974, an epidemic occurred in Japan when the country reduced pertussis (whooping cough) vaccinations. At first, nearly 80% of the children in Japan were vaccinated against pertussis, and as a result only 393 cases of pertussis were reported in Japan that year with no deaths occurring. However, soon rumors began to spread around the country which claimed that the vaccine was unsafe and no longer necessary. This led to only 10% of infants getting vaccinated against pertussis. In the year 1979, an epidemic occurs when Japan had more than 13,000 cases of pertussis and 41 deaths, a significant increase from the year 1974. To address this epidemic, the government once again started a pertussis vaccination program, and as expected, this was successful in lowering the number of cases per year.

Overall, case studies such as this demonstrate the importance of immunization. Furthermore, I believe my source for the information used to answer this question is reliable because it is from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) which is a government-regulated program.

# Question 8.

1) What is the damage to the public medicine and public opinion from such an article which states (incorrectly) that autism is a result of vaccines?

  Incorrect publications such as this affects society on a large scale. Moreover, the threat that arises from an article which incorrectly states that autism is a result of vaccines is future failure to vaccinate children. Once parents heard about this proposed correlation, many decided to not vaccinate their kids in hopes of preventing autism. In addition, since this was an article published in the New York Times, a reputable newspaper in the United States, many people had access to it and trusted what was said. As a result, word spread quickly leading to disastrous results. Also, it is important to recognize that by not vaccinating children, parents are putting many other members of society at risk of contracting the particular disease which could potentially lead to an epidemic or outbreak. Furthermore, although it is less recognized today, the effects of this false study is still seen in society as there are still many people who believe that vaccines so in fact lead to autism. Because the effects of false research has the ability to negatively influence society, it is crucial that these sort of incidents are not repeated and handled with care in the future.

2) What should the role of academic research groups and organizations be to ensure that published information is absolutely correct (i.e., has been properly analyzed) before public exposure?

  There are many roles academic research groups and organizations can take to ensure that published information is accurate. One of the best ways to do this is to have multiple people study and analyze the research before it is published publicly. The margin of error is greatly decreased when many people have looked over and given feedback regarding the information given. Also, it is critical that the people analyzing a study are people who are experts in that particular field. It would have no benefit to have someone who is not knowledge determine if the study is valid or invalid. Only after numerous review processes and absolute vertainity, should the research paper be published.

3) The researcher retracted his paper, which means that he no longer supports its content. Is retracting a paper enough to fix the damage to public medicine? How could the damage be fixed if this you do not think that this is enough?

  Personally, I do not believe that retracting the paper is enough to fix the damage caused to public medicine because the information presented is still out there. Most people tend to believe what they see and do not take the time to personally find out more information. Because of this, retracting the paper is simply not enough as damage to public medicine has already been caused. Nonetheless, it is important to realize that retracting the paper could have some benefit because some people will be able to make the connection that the study was invalid and therefore the conclusions presented were unsupported. However, this will most likely never be everyone who initially heard about the study. The fact that a large amount of people are still unaware even after retraction shows that it is not substantial enough to fix the damage caused. I believe the only way damage could be fixed in addition to retraction is through education and by giving it time.

# Question 9.

One dataset that would be helpful to consider is the Global Summary which shows data regarding global and regional immunizations throughout the years. This data is also very useful because it breaks down the immunizations which allows for more specificity. As of September 2018, the years presented are: 1980, 1990, 2000, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, 2017. Information is released yearly which is helpful for detailed analysis. Also another factor that allows for close analysis is the fact that the population is divided by age. This can be used to determine which age group is affected the most. Another helpful dataset is the Disease Incidence Report which breaks down reported cases by country. Once again, this data breaks down the information according to type of disease and year. If one is looking for information regarding different countries and their vaccination techniques, this is the report to look for.

# Question 10.

There were many things that resonated with me after Dr. Becky Dawson and Dr. Amelia Finaret’s talk. One thing is particular is the how both professors are involved in data analysis, yet have two completely different approaches. For example, Dr. Becky Dawson stated that research done by doctors regarding cures to diseases and such are rarely shared with the public for fact checking while Dr. Amelia Finerat, who specializes in economic research, emphasized the importance of public sharing. This was the part of the discussion which stuck out to me the most because although I had not realized it before, it made sense to me as to why it would be that. Overall, the talk was very motivating and interesting.
